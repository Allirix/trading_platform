# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# If you are new to React:

1.  [Download and Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.  (Optional) [Download and Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3.  Open a terminal in the "frontend/" folder. With VS Code installed, simply right click on the folder and click "Open with Code" then open the terminal.
4.  Run the command `npm i` or `npm install` to install node_modules, the dependncies folder
5.  Run the command `npm run start` to run a script in the node_modules/bin folder to start the development server
6.  Navigate to the site. Typically on PORT 3000. http://localhost:3000

## The Project Structure

### App

The App folder stores the main logic for the application. Routing, fetching, components, etc

### assets

The assets folder contains all the statics files like images.

You can include third-party js and css libraries, but generally these are added with npm or over a CDN.

### helpers

Decoupled pure functions that can be used anywhere in the project

### pages

All the pages in the application. These are routed to in App/index.js using logic from ./routes.js

### store

A global storage object that can be accessed anywhere in the application. It is not used currently.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
